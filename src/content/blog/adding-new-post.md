description:
OpenAI has launched a new platform called the GPT Store, which allows users to create and share customized versions of the ChatGPT model. This platform simplifies the process of creating tailored AI models for specific tasks, democratizing AI development. The GPT Store is compared to Apple's App Store for its potential to revolutionize AI application development and distribution. It could become a significant revenue source for developers and OpenAI, similar to how the App Store benefited Apple and its developers. As the GPT Store prepares to launch, questions arise about its economics, including OpenAI's revenue share, pricing options for developers, and whether the GPT Store will become the App Store of the AI age.

## OpenAI Announces GPTs and ChatGPT Store

OpenAI has recently announced the launch of GPTs and the ChatGPT Store, marking a significant step forward in the realm of AI customization. This new platform allows users to create AI models that are tailored for specific tasks, offering a new level of personalization in AI applications.

### What is the GPT Store?

The GPT Store is a new initiative by OpenAI that was introduced as a part of the ChatGPT website. It is designed to be a marketplace for those who build with OpenAI's technology. The GPT Store is hyped because it simplifies the process of creating customized GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) using OpenAI's powerful large language model, GPT-4.

### How Does the GPT Builder Work?

OpenAI's GPT Builder is a tool that allows users to specify the capabilities they want their GPT to have in plain language. The GPT Builder then attempts to create a simplified version of ChatGPT that is designed to perform those specific functions. This process is meant to be straightforward, especially when compared to programming other types of software.

### The Future of AI Customization

The GPT Store is being compared to Apple's App Store because of its potential to revolutionize the way AI applications are developed and distributed. It could become a significant source of revenue for third-party developers and OpenAI itself, much like the App Store did for Apple and its developers.

### Key Questions and Considerations

As the OpenAI GPT Store prepares to launch, there are critical questions regarding how OpenAI will handle the economics of the store. These include the percentage OpenAI will take from custom GPT sales or subscriptions, the pricing options and mechanisms available to developers, how much developers will be able to charge, and whether the GPT Store will become the App Store of the AI age.

The GPT Store is poised to offer a unique advantage by allowing developers to leverage OpenAI's advanced AI technology to create and sell their own AI-powered applications. This could lead to a new era of innovation and growth in the AI industry.
